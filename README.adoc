== Overview

In this repo a local kind setup is provided.
Also, it is used to bundle some tutorials and pocs which are using that kind cluster.

IMPORTANT: *WindowsUser*: To be able to run k8s in docker some additional steps are necessary. See documentation link:windows-and-docker/README.adoc[here]


== Start the k8s cluster
